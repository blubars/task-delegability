\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Humans and machines offer complementary abilities. Some tasks are suitable for automation (machine control), some should arguably not be automated (human control), and some are amenable to a mix of the two (human-in-the-loop or machine-in-the-loop designs). What factors go into this classification? When is one paradigm more appropriate than another? By examining factors behind task delegation, human ability, and machine ability for a variety of tasks, we aim to develop a taxonomy of task spaces which help contextualize research and design choices for designing more human-centered automated systems.
\end{abstract}

\section{Task Factors}
To explain the human and task factors behind a task delegation decision, we consider a model with four main dimensions: a person's \textbf{goal} in undertaking the task, their perception of the task's \textbf{difficulty}, their perception of \textbf{risk} associated with accomplishing the task, and finally their \textbf{trust} in the AI agent to accomplish the task.

\subsection{Purpose/Goal}
The goal dimension examines the reasons someone may be interested in accomplishing a given task and to the expected utility that accompanies the task's successful completion. How important is accomplishing this task, and why? Is the task personally meaningful? Is it a stepping-stone to a larger goal, or an end in itself? 

Goal-setting examines the factors behind an effective goal, especially on the effects of conscious motivation on performance. Factors that make a goal 

We further break down the goal into three sub-factors: the motivation, interest, and utility of the task.
A decision on the delegation of a given task can vary between individuals. A large part of this variability may be explained by differences in the motivation, interest, and utility[cite?]. These factors combined can be summarized as: is the person motivated to actually undertake the task themselves, and does delegating it undermine or support the goal?

Intrinsic motivation here refers to 

\subsection{Self-efficacy/Difficulty -- needs work on the factors, find papers on social cog theory \& self-efficacy}
Goal-setting theory identifies task difficulty as a primary factor interacting with the goal [cite?]. We propose that an individual's perception of difficulty depends on their self-efficacy and personal experience, their estimates of the cost (time and effort) of accomplishing the goal, and their perception of the task's complexity

Self-efficacy comes from Social Cognitive Theory in psychology, which is concerned with the workings of human agency -- how people can bring about changes in their lives \cite{Bandura-agency}. Properties of human agency are identified as intentionality, forethought, self-reactiveness, and self-reflectiveness. Self-reactiveness involves motivating and constructing courses of action. The last involves personal examination of abilities and pursuits. 

A perception of difficulty may be poorly calibrated if the person has little experience with the task. If the person does have experience, we propose that self-efficacy is largely correlated with a perception of the task's difficulty. Note that if outcomes are more random or not related to personal effort, then self-efficacy may not be as strongly linked with motivation and action [cite: Bandura]

[cite: Bandura ] defines self-efficacy as a person's "beliefs about their capabilities to exercise control over events that affect their lives." It can be thought of as a task-specific self-confidence: a high degree of self-efficacy means that an individual is confident in their ability to accomplish a task. [why we think this might be important]

In Social Cognitive Theory, self-efficacy is thought to effect motivation.  Individuals with low self-efficacy tend to avoid more challenging tasks, while higher self-efficacy can lead to more motivation and higher goals \cite{Bandura-89}.

Self-efficacy is a belief in one's capabilities, it is partly a reflection of their actual capabilities, or performance accomplishments. But it also arises through social persuasion and vicarious experience and depends on emotional states \cite{Bandura-89}.

We propose that self-efficacy can be at least partially explained in terms of personal experience/familiarity with the task and the skills or abilities required. More experience with the task would logically give rise to a deeper understanding of the challenges, strategies, and skills required to complete the task. If the person feels that they have the necessary abilities, then their self-efficacy would rise. [cite]

%\section{References}
%The references section should be labeled ``References" and should appear at the very end of the paper (don't end the paper with references, and then put a figure by itself on the last page). A sample list of references is given later on in these instructions. Please use a consistent format for references. Poorly prepared or sloppy references reflect badly on the quality of your paper and your research. Please prepare complete and accurate citations.

\section{Survey Data Experiments}

\subsection{Factor Weights and Predictive Model}
Split the 200 tasks into training, validation, and test data (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)? Use the survey results from some of the task data as a training, build a model, and present the accuracy of the model on a held-out test set.

\subsection{Clustering?}
People will use different thought processes and considerations when arriving at a delegation decision. For example, one person may tend to value personal meaning and motivation more than another person, who may favor utility along a more logical cost-benefit analysis. Maybe we can cluster on the factors and labels to produce different types of decision processes. May have to use individual responses rather than averaged task responses for this to work.
