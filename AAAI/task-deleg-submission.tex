\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Humans and machines offer complementary abilities. Some tasks are suitable for automation (machine control), some should arguably not be automated (human control), and some are amenable to a mix of the two (human-in-the-loop or machine-in-the-loop designs). What factors go into this classification? When is one paradigm more appropriate than another? By examining factors behind task delegation, human ability, and machine ability for a variety of tasks, we aim to develop a taxonomy of task spaces which help contextualize research and design choices for designing more human-centered automated systems.

%\section{References}
%The references section should be labeled ``References" and should appear at the very end of the paper (don't end the paper with references, and then put a figure by itself on the last page). A sample list of references is given later on in these instructions. Please use a consistent format for references. Poorly prepared or sloppy references reflect badly on the quality of your paper and your research. Please prepare complete and accurate citations.
