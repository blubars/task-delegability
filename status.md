  * Initial survey design based on framework

## 6/4/18
* Payment types:
  * AMT: 20% fee + 5% fee for master's qualification(?) = 0.8 + 0.8*.25 = 1.00

  * Survey Monkey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/collect/audience/preview/?ut_source=sma&ut_source2=pricing_calculate_costs_button  -- estimate of $500 based on 10 questions=same as AMT but no way to filter on quality of responders?
