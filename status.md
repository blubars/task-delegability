* Submitted application to IRB
* Completed survey
* Generating task lists from conference paper topics:
  * [NIPS](https://papers.nips.cc/book/advances-in-neural-information-processing-systems-30-2017), [ICML](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/), [KDD](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/accepted-papers), [CVPR](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/CVPR2018.py), [ACL](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/), [EMNLP](http://emnlp2017.net/accepted-papers.html), [ICRA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome.jsp?punumber=1000639), [ROS](https://roscon.ros.org/2017/#program), [ICCV](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2017.py)

## 6/12/18
* Task framework: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e3pTEMUHLyCIqWE2OolESt-AuVgc0IyBvmKsyff_34/edit#
* TODO for this week:
  * finalize and submit (friday) AI for everyone proposal
  * finalize framework: maybe 4 components, each w/ 3 dimensions (as a starting point for this research)
  * Write up text w/ references describing framework in latex. Format: https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-18/aaai18call/
  * Initial survey design based on framework

## 6/4/18
* Payment types:
  * AMT: 20% fee + 5% fee for master's qualification(?) = 0.8 + 0.8*.25 = 1.00
  * Qualtrics -- requested quote.
  * Survey Monkey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/collect/audience/preview/?ut_source=sma&ut_source2=pricing_calculate_costs_button  -- estimate of $500 based on 10 questions=same as AMT but no way to filter on quality of responders?

## 5/29/18
* IRB: 
  * Protocol doc is in this drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FCR9vWYzkuroLZEVdzY0E2yYbMqMKHAt?usp=sharing 
80 cent compensation, 5 minutes
  * Start with 100 tasks, 5 responses/task. Can either expand to 200 tasks or 10 responses/task.
* Survey design
  * Brian to investigate different survey payment systems (e.g. qualtrics/surveymonkey) to see which is best and most cost-effective
  * Brian to work on finishing factors this week which we will ask about on survey
  * Include ethics factor? Probably not.
  * Also include some demographics: age, computer familiarity, education level
* Brian to sync with Josh
